    <h1>Leuconitocris Bicoloricornis Overview</h1>
    <p>
        <i>Leuconitocris bicoloricornis</i> is a beetle species from the Cerambycidae family, 
        often called longhorn beetles because of their strikingly long antennae. It’s part of 
        the <i>Leuconitocris</i> genus, a group mostly found throughout Africa, and is grouped 
        within the Lamiinae subfamily and Saperdini tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name <i>bicoloricornis</i> hints that its antennae might show two different shades, 
        but detailed accounts of its features are not widely available. Similar to its relatives 
        in the Cerambycidae family, this beetle likely has a slim, stretched-out body. Its larvae 
        are thought to chew through wood, feeding on dead trees or logs and helping break them 
        down in their natural environment.

        Exactly where <i>Leuconitocris bicoloricornis</i> lives isn’t well mapped out, though it’s 
        assumed to roam parts of Africa. Based on where other <i>Leuconitocris</i> species pop up, 
        it could be present in places like Tanzania, Uganda, or South Africa. Not much is known 
        about its looks, habits, or role in nature due to limited records.

        To really understand <i>Leuconitocris bicoloricornis</i>, more studies or sightings are 
        needed, as it’s not one of the better-known beetles in its family. This page gathers what’s 
        currently known about it for anyone curious about longhorn beetles.
